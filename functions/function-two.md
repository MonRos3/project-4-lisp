# Function Two: Set Union

This is a place for the working/unfinished function to exist, so we can see what's going on, collaborate, and test it before the final submission.

- Return the union of set-1 and set-2.

- The result should contain no duplicates.

- Assume set-1 contains no duplicates and set-2 contains no duplicates.

- Examples:

  - (set-union '(1 2) '(2 4)) => '(1 2 4)

```lisp
(defun set-union (set-1 set-2)

  ;;Your implementation go here

)
```
