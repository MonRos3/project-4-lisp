# Function One: Belongingness

This is a place for the working/unfinished function to exist, so we can see what's going on, collaborate, and test it before the final submission.

- Return T if item is a member of set.

- Return NIL if item is not a member of set.

- The type of set is list.

- Examples:

  - (set-member '(1 2) 1) => T

  - (set-member '(1 2) 3) => NIL

```lisp
(defun set-member (set item)

  ;;Your implementation go here

)
```
